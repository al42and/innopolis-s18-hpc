# High performance computing

Innopolis University, Spring 2018

This repo contains some additional material, that is not necessary for the course, but might be interesting if you want to get more hands-on experience.

The material is presented in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html).

You can:
* View them statically here on Github.
* Download them and run them interactively on your local machine.
* Run them interactively using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). See below for details.

## Launching the code interactively

Click the "launch|binder" button near the notebook of interest, and wait a bit. Jupyter instance running somewhere in the cloud should become available.

You can edit code right there, and press Shift+Enter to run current cell and see the output below.
